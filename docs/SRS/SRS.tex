\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
For years, Bridge Engineers in Ontario have based their bridge analysis on the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC)(CSA S6-19) which typically features conservatism and adds excessive costs. This project aims to develop an application ’MTOBridge’ that leverages prepared MATLAB engines (containing the logic for novel analysis methods) and better visualizes their outputs while enhancing usability. This enables the refined methods of analysis to become routine for bridge design and evaluation. Moreover, A unique feature of ’MTOBridge’, which is otherwise unavailable in other bridge design/evaluation software, is that a direct comparison can be obtained between the results obtained from the CHBDC approximate/simplified approach and those from the refined analysis. This endeavor will facilitate confidence in using refined analysis for bridge evaluation and design.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsection{Functional Requirements/Phase in Plan}
  \textbf{FR.1} The Program should be able to call the backend MATLAB functions. \\
  \textbf{Rationale:} To visually display the outputs corresponding to user input, the UI needs to first figure out what those outputs are via the backend MATLAB.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Testing will be performed to confirm whether or not the program can successfully call the MATLAB functions.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Extremely High/Nov 7th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be the first functionality implemnted as it is necessary for proof of concept.\\\\
  
  \noindent\textbf{FR.2} The Program should allow the user to define the characteristics of the truck platoon, including truck configuration, number of trucks, headway, and travel speed.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} The goal of the program is to determine the forces exerted by a given platoon on a bridge, they can come in many different forms, so flexibility in the characteristics
  of the platoon are necessary for the relevance of the simulation.\\ 
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} At least one method of input(text based, dropdown list, etc) exists that allows users to correctly specify those 4 characteristics of the platoon.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} High/Dec 20th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be among the later functionalities as while it is very important for the finished product, it is not proof of concept level.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.3} The Program should allow the user to visualize the effects of their truck platoon characteristic definitions on the final platoon.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} This is mainly to help the user verify that the inputs they put into the program correspond to the platoon they had in mind. As we are making a GUI,
  visual feedback is paramount to functionality.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} There exists some visual representation of the truck platoon that changes to correctly reflect the impact of changes in user input.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} High/Jan 5th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be among the last functionalities implemented as it is dependent on FR.2.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.4} The Program should allow the user to save their current truck platoon configuration for later use.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} Users may be interested in testing the demands a particular truck platoon places on bridges disproportionately more often than others,
   in multiple situations, and over multiple sessions. Making it so they don't have to manually remake it every time is important for the efficient use of The Program.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The Program is capable of storing a truck platoon configuration in some form to be retrieved later.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Medium/Jan 25th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be among the last functionalities implemented as it is among the lowest priority requirements.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.5} The Program should allow the user to load in their previously saved truck platoon configurations.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} A companion piece to FR.4, the ability to save a configuration is functionally useless if you can't pull it back out later.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The Program is capable of correctly recreating a truck platoon configuration from previously saved data.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Medium/Jan 30th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be among the last functionalities implemented as it is among the lowest priority requirements.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.6} The Program should allow the user to define the characteristics of the bridge, inclduing what type of bridge it is and its length.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} Different bridges will react to the same truck platoon differently, therefore specifiying the relevant characteristics of the bridge is necessary for
  the relevance of the simulation.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion} At least one method of input(text based, dropdown list, etc) exists that allows users to correctly specify those 2 characteristics of the bridge.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} High/Dec 20th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be among the later functionalities as while it is very important for the finished product, it is not proof of concept level.\\\\
  
  \noindent\textbf{FR.7} The Program should allow the user to visualize the effects of their bridge characteristic definitions on the final bridge.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} This is mainly to help the user verify that the inputs they put into the program correspond to the bridge they had in mind. As we are making a GUI,
  visual feedback is paramount to functionality.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} There exists some visual representation of the bridge that changes to correctly reflect the impact of changes in user input.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} High/Jan 5th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be among the last functionalities implemented as it is dependent on FR.6.\\\\
  
  \noindent\textbf{FR.8} The Program should allow the user to save their current bridge configuration for later use.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} Users may be interested in testing a particular bridge configuration disproportionately more often than others, in multiple situations
   and over multiple sessions. Making it so they don't have to manually remake it every time is important for the efficient use of The Program.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The Program is capable of storing a bridge configuration in some form to be retrieved later.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Medium/Jan 25th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be among the last functionalities implemented as it is among the lowest priority requirements.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.9} The Program should allow the user to load in their previously saved bridge configurations.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} A companion piece to FR.8, the ability to save a configuration is functionally useless if you can't pull it back out later.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The Program is capable of correctly recreating a bridge configuration from previously saved data.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Medium/Jan 30th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be among the last functionalities implemented as it is among the lowest priority requirements.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.10} The Program should allow the user to define which of the two solvers they are interested in using.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} as the MATLAB backend can solve for both the demand on a concerned section as the platoon drives along, as well as for which section has the 
  highest maximum demand over the course of the whole trip, and these are very different pieces of info, allowing the user to determine which they are currently interested in 
  is important.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} At least one method of input(text based, dropdown list, etc) exists that allows the user to accurately choose which solver they are would like to use.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Extremely High/Nov 20th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This functionality will be implemented relatively early as it is an important part of the core program.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.11} The Program should allow the user to define a section of concern on the bridge.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} The first solver revolves around calculating the demand on a certain point along the bridge as the truck platoon drives over, specifying what point it is
  that we care about is necessray for this function.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} At least one method of input(text based, dropdown list, etc) exists that allows the user to accurately determine a section of concern on the bridge.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Extremely High/Nov 25th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This functionality will be implemented relatively early as it is an important part of the core program.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.12} The Program should allow the user to define a discretization length for their bridge.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} The second solver finds which section has the maximum demand placed on it over the course of the platoon's trip. The discretization length determines how
  many sections the bridge is split up into, which is necessary for the functioning of the second solver.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} At least one method of input(text based, dropdown list, etc) exists that allows the user to accurately define a discretization length for their bridge.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Extremely High/Nov 30th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This functionality will be implemented relatively early as it is an important part of the core program.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.13} The Program should allow the user to define which type of demand placed on the bridge they are interested in, between shear forces and positive/negative moment.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} There are a variety of different demands placed on the bridge as the platoon drives over, and the MATLAB backend contains calculations for all 3 of the
  above mentioned demands. Allowing the user to define which of the 3 they are interested in seeing is necessary for the functionality of the simulation.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} At least one method of input(text based, dropdown list, etc) exists that allows the user to correctly define which of the 3 demands they are interested in
  simulating.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} High/Dec 15th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This functionality will be implemented somewhere in the middle as it is and important part of the program.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.14} The Program should be capable of visualizing the results of the concerned section calculation for the user.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} This is essentially the main purpose of the GUI; displaying the results of the MATLAB backend calculations visually to the user. This is one of the two
  main caluclations to be represented, so this functionality is very necessary.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} There exists an accurate visualization of the mathematical results of the concerned section calculation.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Paramount/Dec 10th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} While this functionality is THE core feature of the program, its proper implementation depends on many other FRs, so it will be fully implmented on the later side.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.15} The Program should be capable of visualizing the results of the critical section calculation for the user.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} This is essentially the main purpose of the GUI; displaying the results of the MATLAB backend calculations visually to the user. This is one of the two
  main caluclations to be represented, so this functionality is very necessary.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} There exists an accurate visualization of the mathematical results of the critical section calculation.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} Paramount/Dec 10th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} While this functionality is THE core feature of the program, its proper implementation depends on many other FRs, so it will be fully implmented on the later side.\\\\

  \noindent\textbf{FR.16} The Program should be capable of outputting a report summarizing the results of its runtime.\\
  \textbf{Rationale:} Having a long term representation of the data presented in the program after the current session of use is over is helpful for engineers comparing
  and contrasting diffrent simulations over time. Without this, the information would be lost as soon as the program was exited.\\
  \textbf{Fit Criterion:} There exists an accurate report that cotains all the relevant data from simulations run over the course of the runtime in some output format.\\
  \textbf{Priority/Phase in Date:} High/Jan 15th\\
  \textbf{Phase in Date Rationale:} This will be among the last functionalities implemented as it is dependent on many other FRs.\\\\

\subsection{Reflection}

As is the nature of a Capstone course, this project will be a learning experience for all 6 of us. we will all have to learn new skills and improve on old ones to see this 
through successfully. Below is a detailed breakdown from each Individual on what they feel will be their most important learnings from this project, and how they plan on
going about them.

\noindent\textbf{Adham}\\
\textbf{Most Important Learning(s):}\\
\textbf{Plan to learn what is needed:}\\\\

\noindent\textbf{David}\\
\textbf{Most Important Learning(s):} I feel I will need to gather some domain specific knowledge, specifically related to bridge engineering. 
I feel I will also need to work on my technical writing skills (formal and succinct). \\
\textbf{Plan to learn what is needed:} We have an amazing resource in Dr. Yang and her students, as they are domain experts in bridge engineering. I think throughout the 
project, speaking to them about bridge engineering will help me learn a lot. I also think a lot can be learned from Google, since a lot of the simpler concepts can be learned 
about through various sources. I will mainly rely on speaking to Dr. Yang and her students, since I know they are a reliable source for information, especially in terms of 
the knowledge required for this project. Technical writing can be improved through gaining valuable feedback from our TA on my writing. This can also be improved
by practicing an iterative process on my writing, where I can go back and try to simplify my writing while maintaining its meaning. I will mainly rely on the latter, since 
I feel I can learn a lot more with the iterative process.\\\\

\noindent\textbf{Pedram}\\
\textbf{Most Important Learning(s):} Personally, the most important learning includes deepening my knowledge of C++ frameworks, specifically Qt which we will be likely using to create the MTOBridge features. I will take this opportunity to learn deeper about interactions between programming languages and how different programs can be synced. I think this is also a great opportunity to understand design thinking and how it can go beyond the everyday user and be applied to an actual engineer. \\
\textbf{Plan to learn what is needed:} My plan involves rapidly understanding of the tools through frequent building and testing. This process can be accelerated with the use of proper documentation or even help of the friends. It’s also crucial to understand about what’s happening in the engine, requiring us to increase our domain knowledge. \\\\

  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
