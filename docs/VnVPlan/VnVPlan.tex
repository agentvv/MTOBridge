This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (MG, MIS, etc).  You can include these even
  before they are written, since by the time the project is done, they will be
  written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
  be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
  something more rigorous/systematic in mind..}

\wss{Remember you have an SRS checklist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

Below are system tests for the functional requirements in the SRS for MTOBridge.
Each functional requirement has at least one system test. The identifiers follow a pattern of
functional requirement number, system test number. For example, FR1.ST2 refers to the second
system test for functional requirement 1.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{File Manager}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UTFR-2.1\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: File location path
					
Output: New MTOBridge instance initialized with the given data instead of the default 

Test Case Derivation: Config file contains data that were previously inputted by a user, so to the load the data we have to restart the process 
					
How test will be performed: The test involves instantiating an MTOBridge process with the saved data and then running our logic checks to validate the saved input.
					
\item{UTFR-2.2\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: File location path 
					
Output: Boolean variable indicating True or False 

Test Case Derivation: Require a method to check for the integrity of the saved configurations as the data can be faulty or incomplete

How test will be performed: The test is performed by validating the completeness and metadata of the file to make sure the file hasn't been corrupted hence preventing an instance construct call with faulty data.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Solver Setup}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UTFR-3.1\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate the desired solver 
					
Output: Calculation results based on the selected solver

Test Case Derivation: The current logic allows for calculation of the demand at different areas called concerened sections. These can show the forces for both a single section as well as the entire bridge. 

How test will be performed: The test involves running a series of pre-determined calculation using both solvers and then comparing with the auotmaic output selecting one solver at a time. 
					

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Bridge Config}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UTFR-4.1\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate the desired section 
					
Output: Calculation results based on the selected section

Test Case Derivation: The current logic allows for calculation of the demand at different areas called concerened sections. These can show the forces for both a single section as well as the entire bridge. 

How test will be performed: Once the section is selected, the test is performed by executing different types of platoon and bridge characteristic to derive actual results. These results are validated and compared to the exepected results calculated through the engine only. 
					
\item{UTFR-4.2\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate the discretization length 
					
Output: Calculation results based on the defined length

Test Case Derivation: In order to use the second solver, the system requires information on the number of equally spaced parts of the bridge. 

How test will be performed: Using an array of discretization lengths, we can take advantage of the engine's efficiency to calculate the maximum demand force in different context and compare with our own expected results. 

\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Calculation Parameters}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UTFR-5.1\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate the desired force type  
					
Output: Calculation results based on the selected parameters 

Test Case Derivation: The current implmentation of the engine allows for calculation across shear, torsion and flexural resistance

How test will be performed: The test entails creating a series of bridge types with different truck platoons that can be tested for all force types such as shear, torsion and flexural. Each data test is manually fed into the engine to output an expected output. 
					
\item{UTFR-5.2\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate the desired moment  
					 
Output: Calculation results based on the selected parameters 

Test Case Derivation: The current implmentation of the engine allows for calculation using postivie and negative moment 

How test will be performed: The test will be performed by using our pool of pre-determined bridge and truck platoon configs to test for both positive and negative moment given a certain force type. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Result Visualizer}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UTFR-6.1\\}

Control: Automatic
				
Initial State: None
					
Input: calculations based on the concerened section 
					
Output: Animation and visualiation highlighting the resulting properties on the specified bridge and load 

Test Case Derivation: As one of the main purposes of the program, the visualization will be interactable to show various views

How test will be performed: Relying on the pre-determined and validated data, we will graph the visulizations of each through the system as well as manually through the data produced by the engine. We can then compare the the expected and actual result across all available views. 
					
\item{UTFR-6.2\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: calculations based on the discretization length 
					
Output:  Animation and visualiation highlighting the resulting properties on the specified bridge and load 

Test Case Derivation: As one of the main purposes of the program, the visualization will be interactable to show various views

How test will be performed: Relying on the pre-determined and validated data, we will graph the visulizations of each through the system as well as manually through the data produced by the engine. We can then compare the the expected and actual result across all available views. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exectution Flow Logging}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UTFR-7.1\\}

Control: Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate logging flags 
					
Output: text output, "logs"

Test Case Derivation: With the engine built in another framework, its important to log every state change throughout the calculations as triggered by the system

How test will be performed: While running multiple calculations, the system is asked to comprehensively log the flow in the engine. The system will be interrupted at times to test the robustness as well. The resulting logs should be clearly highlighting the steps taken including any errors or warnings.

\section{Unit Test Description}

As outlined in our \href{https://github.com/agentvv/MTOBridge/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan}, we will be using Qt Test and Google Test to conduct our unit testing. These testing frameworks will allow us to create and run unit tests quickly and easily.

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Darren}\\
\textbf{Most Important Learning(s):} We intend to use tools for validation including setting up CI/CD on the repo and clang-tidy for code analysis. Although I've used these or similar tools in the past, I haven't personally prepared them before.\\
\textbf{Plan to learn what is needed:} Some approaches for learning this is to research into the respective tools and reviewing past projects that used them, or to participate in their implementation and collaborate with team members on this. These aren't mutually exclusive, but I intend to mainly focus on learning through participating in the implementation and working with team members, since I feel that will be more effective in bringing results to the project.\\

\noindent\textbf{your name here}\\
\textbf{Most Important Learning(s):} text 1.\\
\textbf{Plan to learn what is needed:} text 2.\\
