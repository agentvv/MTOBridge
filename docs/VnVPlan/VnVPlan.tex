This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (MG, MIS, etc).  You can include these even
  before they are written, since by the time the project is done, they will be
  written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
  be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
  something more rigorous/systematic in mind..}

\wss{Remember you have an SRS checklist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{File Manager}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UTFR-2.1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: File location path
					
Output: New MTOBridge instance initialized with the given data instead of the default 

Test Case Derivation: The initial data has to be checked before being plugged into the program 
					
How test will be performed: The test involves instantiating an MTOBridge process with the saved data and then running our logic checks to validate the saved input.
					
\item{UTFR-2.2\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: File location path 
					
Output: Boolean variable indicating True or False 

Test Case Derivation: Require a method to check for the integrity of the saved configurations

How test will be performed:The test is performed by validating the completeness and metadata of the file to make sure the file hasn't been corrupted hence preventing an instance construct call with faulty data.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Solver Setup}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{UTFR-3.1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate the desired solver 
					
Output: Calculation results based on the selected solver

Test Case Derivation: The current logic allows for calculation of the demand at different areas called concerened sections. These can show the forces for both a single section as well as the entire bridge. 

How test will be performed: The test involves running a series of pre-determined calculation using both solvers and then comparing with the auotmaic output selecting one solver at a time. 
					
\item{UTFR-3.2\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate the desired solver  
					
Output: 

Test Case Derivation: Require a method to check for the integrity of the saved configurations

Test Case Derivation: The current logic allows for calculation of the demand at different areas called concerened sections. These can show the forces for both a single section as well as the entire bridge. 

How test will be performed: Once the section is selected, the test is performed by executing different types of platoon and bridge characteristic to derive actual results. These results are validated and compared to the exepected results calculated through the engine only. 
					
\item{UTFR-4.2\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate the discretization length 
					
Output: Calculation results based on the defined length

Test Case Derivation: In order to use the second solver, the system requires information on the number of equally spaced parts of the bridge. 

How test will be performed: Using an array of discretization lengths, we can take advantage of the engine's efficiency to calculate the maximum demand force on different context and compare with our own result. 

\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Calculation Parameters}

\item{UTFR-5.1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: None
					
Input: text input to indicate the desired force type and moment

  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
