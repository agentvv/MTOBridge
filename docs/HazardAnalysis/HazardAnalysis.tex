\section{Introduction}

This document is a hazard analysis of MTOBridge. A hazard is a potentially harmful event resulting
from the conditions of the system and the environment.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

This document describes the components of MTOBridge, the potential hazards associated with each, and 
any new functional requirements that can be derived from these hazards. This process is important to 
identify any potential issues with the system, and then design the system to eliminate the potential issues.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

This hazard analysis addresses the system that consists of the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item UI Component, for providing a graphic display to the user and visualizing MATLAB results
	\item Input Handler Component, for processing user inputs
	\item MATLAB Interaction Component, for calling scripts and supplying specified arguments to them
	\item MATLAB Engine Component, for performing bridge calculations
	\item File Manager Component, for reading inputs from files and saving results in various formats
\end{enumerate}

The system boundary includes these software components and any dependency files required for the application to operate. Although the MATLAB Engine Component is owned by the client and its exact contents verified independent of this project, this hazard analysis will address it due to being a crucial component of the system.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

We will not be making any critical assumptions about the system. As mentioned above, the MATLAB engine 
is a critical component of the system. We must address it with the hazard analysis and will not make
any assumptions about its correctness and functionality.

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
Using the results of FMEA, we can derive the following safety and security requirements for our system in order to mitigate the identified hazards. \\

\textbf{SR-1}:
The system must be able to synchronize the display of the truck platoon with the input bridge load through various logic checks and boundary tests. An alarm/error shall be produced if the display requirements across both modules are not met. 

\emph{Rationale}: While splitting the calculation display modules into two modules; platoon trip and bridge load display, can simplify each part, it can lead to mismatch in respective display.\\

\textbf{SR-2}: 
The system must produce a log of calls and functions with a detailed trace of function callbacks highlighting the code locations. The log will include timestamps along with software environment information such as input.

\emph{Rationale}:
The logs will be directly used in the debugging process which can be presented in different ways to the user. Such logs can prove useful in case of engine crashes, data loss and timeouts. \\

\textbf{SR-3}:
In case of an Matlab engine failure, the system must be able to use the recorded logs to provide a clear message to the user.

\emph{Rationale}: Logs while carrying a lot of information can be too heavy to digest, we can help the user further with a bit of processing.\\ 

\textbf{SR-4}:
The system must validate numeric values are within an acceptable range before being passed on to other components.

\emph{Rationale}: Accidental changes of input can cause massive shifts in the analysis and cause inaccurate results. (e.g. adding extra 0â€™s) \\

\textbf{SR-5}:
The system must validate input type before being passed on to other components.

\emph{Rationale}: This is to prevent accidental mix and match of inputs for example inputting structure material inside load section.\\

\textbf{SR-6}:
The system must include information that indicates the integrity of the file and whether the file creation is completed.

\emph{Rationale}: This can help remove the risks associated with corrupt files during an import or export. \\

\textbf{SR-7}:
The system must automatically save to a file whenever user changes the configuration or at reasonable time intervals

\emph{Rationale}: This is meant to mitigate risks associated with system crashes or power outages.\\



\section{Roadmap}

The new requirements derived in the previous section can be prioritized based on time to develop, probability of happening and the severity with severity given the most weight. As such we believe requirements that can disrupt the user-flow must be integrated regardless of other factors. These requirements will be developed as part of the primary development phase while the rest are allocated as stretch requirements for later implementation. 

\subsection{Phase 1}
Critical requirements include SR-1, SR-2, SR-3, SR-4, SR-5 and SR-6. The first requirement is meant to mitigate the risk of mismatch and miscalculations across modules which even though very unlikely can cause faulty results with a low chance of detection. SR-2 and SR-3 are meant to implement the logging system which will directly support debugging especially due to engine and pipeline erros. SR-4, SR-5 and SR-6 are meant to mitigate the risks associated with input and sophisticated time handling. While such requirements can quickly grow and take time to develop, they have high probability and severity due to continuous work models. 
\subsection{Phase 2}
Phase two requirements include SR-7 and SR-8. SR-7 is another security requirement meant to validate imported files and their integrity through different methods. While a fairly severe requirement, we believe that it has a low probability and high time to develop. Similarly, SR-8 is another requirement which can protect the user against unforeseen environment changes such as BSODâ€™s or power outages. Such requirements are of low priority and are scheduled as part of the stretch requirements for later development.
