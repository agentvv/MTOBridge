\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

This hazard analysis addresses the system that consists of the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item UI Component, for providing a graphic display to the user and visualizing MATLAB results
	\item Input Handler Component, for processing user inputs
	\item MATLAB Interaction Component, for calling scripts and supplying specified arguments to them
	\item MATLAB Engine Component, for performing bridge calculations
	\item File Manager Component, for reading inputs from files and saving results in various formats
\end{enumerate}

The system boundary includes these software components and any dependency files required for the application to operate. Although the MATLAB Engine Component is owned by the client and its exact contents verified independent of this project, this hazard analysis will address it due to being a crucial component of the system.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

We will be making the following assumptions about the system:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The MATLAB Engine Component will take less than 1 second to perform bridge calculations. 
    This is because the equations that need to be solved have closed form solutions, and should be easy
    to compute.
    \item The MATLAB Engine Component will be correct. We are assuming this because we do not have control
    over the MATLAB scripts that will be running.
    \item The user of the system will have input (keyboard, mouse) and output (monitor/display) devices.
\end{enumerate}
