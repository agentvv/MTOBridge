\section{Introduction}

This document is a hazard analysis of MTOBridge. Background for the project can be found in \href{https://github.com/agentvv/MTOBridge/blob/main/docs%20Rev1/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf}{the Problem Statement}. A hazard is a potentially harmful event resulting
from the conditions of the system and the environment.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

This document describes the components of MTOBridge, the potential hazards associated with each, and 
any new functional requirements that can be derived from these hazards. This process is important to 
identify any potential issues with the system, and then design the system to eliminate the potential issues.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

This hazard analysis addresses the system that consists of the following components:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item UI Component, for providing a graphic display to the user and visualizing MATLAB results
	\item Input Handler Component, for processing user inputs
	\item MATLAB Interaction Component, for calling scripts and supplying specified arguments to them
	\item MATLAB Engine Component, for performing bridge calculations
	\item File Manager Component, for reading inputs from files and saving results in various formats
\end{enumerate}

The system boundary includes these software components and any dependency files required for the application to operate. Although the MATLAB Engine Component is owned by the client and its exact contents verified independent of this project, this hazard analysis will address it due to being a crucial component of the system.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

We will not be making any critical assumptions about the system. As mentioned above, the MATLAB engine 
is a critical component of the system. We must address it with the hazard analysis and will not make
any assumptions about its correctness and functionality.

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}
Using the results of FMEA, we can derive the following safety and security requirements for our system in order to 
mitigate the identified hazards. \\

\textbf{SR-1}:
The system must be able to synchronize the display of the truck platoon with the bridge load. A correction will be
made if the two parts are out of sync, or an error will be displayed if necessary. 

\emph{Rationale}: While splitting the calculation display modules into two modules, truck platoon and bridge load 
display, can simplify each part, it can lead to mismatch in each respective display.

\emph{Trace}: HA-6, HA-7\\

\textbf{SR-2}: 
The system must have thread safety between the UI and other connected components.

\emph{Rationale}: In order to avoid race conditions and deadlocks that could result in undesirable behavior,
thread safety must be an integral part of the interaction between components.

\emph{Trace}: HA-11, HA-12 \\

\textbf{SR-3}: 
The system must produce a detailed log of function calls made to MATLAB Engine. The log will include timestamps along 
with software environment information such as current input.

\emph{Rationale}:
The logs will be directly used in the debugging process which can be presented in different ways to the user. Such logs 
can prove useful in case of engine crashes, data loss and timeouts.

\emph{Trace}: HB-1, HB-2, HC-1, HC-2, HC-3\\

\textbf{SR-4}:
In case of an Matlab engine failure, the system must be able to use the recorded logs and provide a clear message to 
the user.

\emph{Rationale}: The logs may have too much information for a user, which may not be helpful. A simple error message
should be shown to the user to inform them of the issue.

\emph{Trace}: HB-1, HB-2, HC-1, HC-2, HC-3\\

\textbf{SR-5}:
The system must validate numeric values are within an acceptable range before being passed on to other components.

\emph{Rationale}: Accidental changes of input can cause massive shifts in the analysis and cause inaccurate results 
(e.g. adding extra 0’s).

\emph{Trace}: HD-1 \\

\textbf{SR-6}:
The system must validate input type before being passed on to other components.

\emph{Rationale}: This is to prevent accidental mix and match of inputs.

\emph{Trace}: HD-2\\

\textbf{SR-7}:
The system must include information that indicates the integrity of the file and whether the file creation is completed.

\emph{Rationale}: This can help remove the risks associated with corrupt files during an import or export. 

\emph{Trace}: HE-1\\

\textbf{SR-8}:
The system must automatically save to a file whenever user changes the configuration or at reasonable time intervals.

\emph{Rationale}: This is meant to mitigate risks associated with system crashes or power outages.

\emph{Trace}: HE-2\\

\section{Roadmap}

The new requirements derived in the previous section can be prioritized based on time to develop, probability, and 
severity. We believe functionality that, if not implemented, can disrupt the user-flow must be integrated into the 
system. These requirements will be developed as part of the primary development phase, while the rest are allocated as 
stretch requirements for later implementation. 

\subsection{Phase 1}
Critical requirements include SR-1, SR-2, SR-5 and SR-6. SR-1 is meant to mitigate the risk of mismatch and 
miscalculations across modules which, even though very unlikely, can cause faulty results with a low chance of 
detection. SR-2 is to avoid any problems that may occur in a multi-threaded system, where there is significant risk.
SR-5, SR-6 are meant to mitigate the risks associated with user input. While these requirements may 
take a long time to develop, they have high probability and severity and should be implemented as soon as possible.

\subsection{Phase 2}
Phase two requirements include SR-3, SR-4, SR-7 and SR-8. SR-3 and SR-4 are to implement the logging system which will
directly support debugging, especially due to engine and pipeline errors. Supporting debugging would be helpful for developement
and for future changes, but it is not an important feature to have immediately. SR-7 is a security requirement meant to
validate imported files and their integrity through different methods. While a fairly important requirement, we believe
that it has a low probability of occurrence and high time to develop. Similarly, SR-8 is another requirement which can
protect the user against unforeseen environment changes such as computer crashes or power outages. Such requirements are
of low priority and are scheduled as part of the stretch requirements for later development.
