\plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
feedback.  In addition, several CEAB (Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board)
Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}

\plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

\plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback 
from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the 
supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

\subsection{SRS and Hazard Analysis}
\subsubsection{SRS}

\subsubsection{Hazard Analysis}
The changes made to the hazard analysis in response to feedback were relatively small. These changes mainly related to clarity and completeness, and had little impact on the final implementation. The largest change that was made was adding a new hazard relating to the case of lost saved data. Here is a complete list of changes:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Swapped the position of HA-11 and HA-12 for better readability
  \item Clarified certain vague failure effects (e.g., "program cannot function")
  \item Modified incorrect failure conditions in HC-2 and HD-2
  \item Moved SR-3 and SR-4 to phase 2 of implementation
  \item Changed some of the recommended actions in HA-1 to better resolve the identified failures
  \item Clarified some of the recommended actions in HA-1, HA-6, and HD-3
  \item Added background information in section 1
  \item Added a new hazard for lost save data. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design Iteration (LO11)}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?}

\textbf{Pedram:} Arriving at our final design was a process of rapid requirements gathering, feasibility analysis and software design built upon the initial findings and the proof of concept. In terms of requirements gathering, the client was regularly given multiple mockups of the proposed designs to choose from in addition to refining the requirements, constrains and assumptions. The team would often conduct brief feasibility analysis to better understand the priority and complexity of each ask. Very importantly, relational tools and diagrams where used in documenting and detailing the different components and their interactions.  From the final design, a similar iterative approach was taken for the final implementation. The first steps, including the Rev0, was seen as a prototyping stage where the team made the basic infrastructure and user interface that could later be shaped in different ways. A similar iterative approach was taken with the client where the prototypes where refined and presented in a biweekly manner to clearly highlight what has been completed and what is left to implement. Toward the end, most members focused on rigorous testing to ensure the validity of the implementation.

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?}

\textbf{Pedram:} As a front-facing software project, the design decisions used in MTOBridge were mostly justified through the perspectives of the stakeholders, often being the client and final user. Nevertheless, there were many factors that also helped justify each decision. For starters, most of the decisions were justified considering the implicit or explicit trade-offs that would be involved. For example, certain frameworks offered less robustness but a higher performance which was not ideal for our scenario. At the same time, there were many constraints that we had to adhere. The program had to be portable and installable on any Windows 10 and 11 machine without the requirement for any other software or applications. These constraint also often included the actual limitations of the framework being used which could vary by use case. Finally, the assumptions and the context for this project, specifically the user behavior and future requirements were other influencing factors.

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

\plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in marketing your 
product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you could 
sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units would you have to 
sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be sold, like an 
open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How many potential 
users currently exist?}

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}
\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan, 
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the 
technology you planned on using?}
